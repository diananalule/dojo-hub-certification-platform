# Dojo Hub Certification Platform

A full-stack certification platform for **Dojo Hub (SMC)** — course delivery, evaluator-graded submissions, and cryptographically verifiable certificates with scannable QR verification.

Three roles, one platform:

- **Students** enrol in tracks, work through modules and lesson topics, sit quizzes, and submit work for review
- **Evaluators** grade submissions against competency rubrics and provide feedback
- **Admins** build curriculum, manage users and levels, and oversee platform metrics and audit history

Every issued certificate carries an HMAC-signed hash and a QR code resolving to a public verification page, so a credential can be checked by anyone without an account.

| **Zustand** | — | Client state |

### Infrastructure

Docker Compose runs PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO locally. A shared `packages/shared` workspace holds the TypeScript enums and DTOs used by both apps, so the API and frontend never drift apart on the data contract.

## Repository layout

```
platform/              The application (npm workspaces monorepo)
  apps/api/            NestJS backend
  apps/web/            Next.js frontend
  packages/shared/     Shared enums + DTO types
  docker-compose.yml   postgres, redis, minio
src/, index.html       Original standalone prototype, kept for reference
```

## Getting started

Full setup instructions, demo accounts, and architecture notes are in **[platform/README.md](platform/README.md)**.

Quick version — from the `platform/` directory:

```bash
npm install
npm run db:up            # start postgres, redis, minio
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run prisma:seed
npm run dev:api          # http://localhost:4000  (docs at /api/docs)
npm run dev:web          # http://localhost:3000
```

**Requirements:** Node.js 20.9+, Docker Desktop.

### Environment variables

Real `.env` files are deliberately excluded from version control. Copy the `.env.example` templates and supply your own values — database URL, JWT secrets, S3 credentials, and an `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` if you want AI-assisted grading. Manual evaluator review works without it.
